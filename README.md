# Global-Sky-Survey
A Global Survey of the Sky and Deep Space Objects

# About
`GSS` is a small and modest Sky Survey, mainly from **Bortle 9**, so the quality won't be the best.  
Its fully open source and free to contribute to, but I recommend you make your own repository with: `#globalss` oresle this repository will grow massive.  
To any future contributers: THANKS!
